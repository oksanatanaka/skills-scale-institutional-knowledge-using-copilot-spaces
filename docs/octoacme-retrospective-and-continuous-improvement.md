# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
- Track action item completion rate (see metrics section below)

## Action Item Follow-Up Tracking Template

Use this template to track retrospective action items and ensure follow-through:

| ID | Action Item | Owner | Due Date | Status | Completion Date | Notes |
|----|-------------|-------|----------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| AI-001 | [Action description] | [Name] | YYYY-MM-DD | Open/In Progress/Complete/Blocked | | |
| AI-002 | [Action description] | [Name] | YYYY-MM-DD | Open/In Progress/Complete/Blocked | | |

**Status Definitions:**
- **Open:** Not yet started
- **In Progress:** Actively being worked on
- **Complete:** Done and verified
- **Blocked:** Cannot proceed; needs escalation
- **Cancelled:** No longer relevant; document reason

## Example Action Item Template

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes

## Action Item Completion Rate Metric

Track the effectiveness of your continuous improvement process by measuring action item completion:

### Metric Definition
**Action Item Completion Rate = (Completed Action Items / Total Action Items) × 100**

### Tracking Template

| Sprint/Period | Total Items | Completed | Completion Rate | Carried Over | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| Sprint 1 | 5 | 4 | 80% | 1 | |
| Sprint 2 | 6 | 5 | 83% | 1 | |
| Sprint 3 | 4 | 4 | 100% | 0 | |

### Targets and Thresholds
| Completion Rate | Status | Action |
|-----------------|--------|--------|
| ≥ 80% | 🟢 Healthy | Continue current approach |
| 60-79% | 🟡 Needs attention | Review capacity, prioritize items |
| < 60% | 🔴 Requires action | Reduce items per retro, escalate blockers |

### Best Practices
- Limit to 2-3 action items per retrospective to maintain focus
- Assign owners immediately during the retrospective
- Set realistic due dates (usually within next sprint)
- Review carryover items—if an item carries over twice, re-evaluate or escalate
- Celebrate completed improvements to reinforce the feedback loop
